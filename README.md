# CatTravel

## About This Project

Welcome to CatTravel! This is a travel tracker app for managing and tracking different trips for users. This app was built in four days, and features filters to view all, upcoming, past, and pending trips. A user can also request a new trip, get a quote for it, and send it off to their travel agent to approve it.

### Goals and Objectives

- Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
- Work with an API to send and receive data
- Solidify the code review process
- Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

## Built With

- Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
- Mocha and Chai
- Fetch API

## Wins and Challenges

Some challenges included working with double data sets in the Trip Repository class method CalculcuateCostPerYear.

Some wins included debugging quickly, and deleting unused classes when it became clear they were redundant.
